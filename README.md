# About Me

## Interest
I tend to spend most of my time at work and doing activites with my family. I currently married with 4 kids _(3 daughters and 1 son)_. When I do have free time I usually spend them doing 1 of 5 things. Listed below are my hobbies in a specific order with number one being my favorite. 

1. Dance - Jazz, Tap, and Ballet

   I've done Ballet, Jazz and Tap since I was a kid and when I am not too busy I like to go to my old studio and help teach a class or too. It allows me to get so exercise in and is alway a blast from the past nostalgia feeling everytime I go.
   
3. Reading I like reading suspense novals and historial fiction novels

4. Shopping _(specifically online shopping)_

5. Outdoor running

6. Watching YouTube Shorts
